    <p>Maybe you feel a bit like this image right now. If you're confused, that's a good sign. The universe 
    is a daunting and fascinating and incomprehensible place. With all these microscopic and macroscopic interactions
  happening around us and within us without our knowledge, it's easy to feel like you're blindfolded and strapped
    to the side of a rocket hurtling towards something you can't see. But as string theory teaches us, there is great value in accepting 
    the limitations of our relative blindess and finding creative ways to look beyond and embrace the mystery. 
    <br><br>I hope that these pages offered some insight into the worlds of string theory, quantum mechanics, general 
    relativity, and physics as a whole. I'm certainly not going to offer the best, clearest, fullest, or most accurate
    explanations. What I can do is add to the existing body of knowledge in ways that make sense to me, and I hope, to
    you.
